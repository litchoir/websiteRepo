      <h4>Background</h4>
      <p>The University of Notre Dame Liturgical Choir, founded in 1973 as the Chapel Choir, is composed of approximately 70 male and female singers drawn from all areas of the undergraduate and graduate student body. The choir sings at the Basilica of the Sacred Heart, a French Gothic structure built in 1871 by University founder Fr. Edward Sorin.<br><br>Led by director Dr. Andrew McShane and assistant director Jonathan Hehn, the Liturgical Choir performs a repertoire drawn on the diverse traditions of a cappella and accompanied sacred music from the Renaissance through the twentieth century. In recognition of the Liturgical Choir's special ministry to the Notre Dame community, Pope John Paul II extended his apostolic blessing upon the Choir in 1989.

      <h4>Auditions</h4>
    <p>
General auditions for all University choral ensembles are held at the beginning of each academic year, during Welcome Weekend.<br><br>
<i>However, at any point during the academic year, students can request an audition by appointment by emailing <a class="fixed_links" href="mailto:amcshane@nd.edu">amcshane@nd.edu</a>. Membership in the Liturgical Choir is open to undergraduate and graduate students of all majors enrolled at Notre Dame, St. Mary's, or Holy Cross. </i><br><br>
At your audition, you will be asked to sing a prepared piece or a hymn that you know (Amazing Grace, My Country 'Tis of Thee, Praise to the Lord are popular choices!). We will test your range and your ear, and conclude the audition with a sight-reading exercise. The choral audition takes less than 10 minutes.

   <li>
     <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">add</i>How can I join?</div>
     <div class="collapsible-body">View auditions information <a class="fixed_links" href="./about.html#triple-threat">here</a>.</div>
   </li>
   <li>
     <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">add</i>Can I be in both band and choir?</div>
     <div class="collapsible-body">Yes! In years past, band-choir members will typically leave Tuesday rehearsal 15-20 minutes early and skip Thursday rehearsal for band on football weekends. Be sure to inform the both our director, Andy, and Sam Sanchez about your situation. </div>
   </li>
   <li>
     <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">add</i>What are the Liturgical Choir's biggest events?</div>
     <div class="collapsible-body">We sing at five services during Holy Week and Easter: Tenebrae on Holy Thursday evening, the Good Friday service, the Easter Vigil, the 10am Easter Sunday Mass, and Easter Vespers. We prepare for these throughout most of the spring semester.<br> Our other big event is our annual choir tour, which is international every other year.</div>
   </li>
   <li>
     <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">add</i>I'm not Catholic. Can I still sing in the Liturgical Choir?</div>
     <div class="collapsible-body">Of course! While our focus is assisting with the Catholic Liturgy, we welcome people from all faiths. However, it should be noted that the 10am Basilica Mass is the Liturgical Choir's primary ministry, and conflicts with this time may make the Liturgical Choir a difficult commitment.</div>
   </li>
   <li>
     <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">add</i>What else does the Liturgical Choir do besides sing?</div>
     <div class="collapsible-body">We have various choir events, such as our annual concession stand, Choir Appreciation Week, an S-Choi-R (a fun themed dance with a theme like "Rhyme Without Reason"), social gatherings, and an end-of-year cookout.  We go caroling around Christmas, and we eat dinner together as a choir in the dining hall after every rehearsal on Tuesdays and Thursdays and every Mass on Sundays.</div>
   </li>
   <li>
     <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">add</i>Can graduate students join?</div>
     <div class="collapsible-body">Absolutely. Most of our grad students are in the Masters in Sacred Music program, but we have others from all different departments on campus.
</div>
   </li>
   <li>
     <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">add</i>If I don't go to Notre Dame, or if I live off-campus, how can I come to choir dinner?</div>
     <div class="collapsible-body">Most (if not all) choir members are more than willing to spare an extra meal swipe for off campus students.  St. Mary's and Holy Cross students should be able to get the equivalent of meal swipes.  If you run into an issue, contact the choir president, Julian Mancini, or secretary, Michael Kurkowski.</div>
